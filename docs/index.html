      <h1>Chowtime</h1>
      <p>
        Chowtime is a mobile App built using React Native, that utilizes the Yelp Fusion API to decide on a restaurant for you! Just provide a few search criteria and let Chowtime handle the rest. Don't like the suggestion? It'll give you another one until you do. It even gives you the option to get directions straight to the restaurant. Now, deciding what to eat can be as simple as opening an app!
